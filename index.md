## Menubar utility that clears corrupt Xcode project indexes

When Xcode autocomplete abandons you, quit Xcode. Tap your project's name in the Autocomplete Rescue menubar popover. The corrupted indexes will be removed and Xcode will restart.

You can hot swap between Xcode versions (e.g., release and beta) and monitor multiple derived data directories.
